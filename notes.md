# Working Notes

## What this file is for

A scratch file for open questions, unresolved oddities, and the next thing to do.
It exists so a new chat session can pick up where the last one left off without
re-deriving context.

**This is not the decision log.** The decision log is append-only and holds
*resolved* decisions with dates and reasons. This file holds the opposite:
things still in the air.

## How to maintain it

- **Delete items once they're resolved.** This file is meant to be edited and
  pruned. An item that has been settled does not belong here — it belongs in
  `decision-log.md` as a dated entry, and it should be removed from this file
  in the same sitting.
- If it never turns into a decision (just a fixed bug or a dead end), delete it
  without logging it anywhere.
- Keep it short. If this file is getting long, items are being added and not
  cleared.
- **Claude: at the end of a session, check this file and prompt me to remove
  anything that got resolved during it, and to add anything new that's still
  open.** Don't let it drift out of date.
- For this file to be visible to Claude, it must be added to the Claude project
  files, not just committed to the repo. Those are separate places.

## Open questions

- Cross-table `permit_nbr` duplicate check not yet run on the combined
  frame (`whole_f`, 240,201 rows). Each table is internally unique and the
  date ranges don't overlap, so zero is expected — but a collision *across*
  tables hasn't been tested. Last unverified assumption before the weekly
  series.

- `CD` nulls: 113 in `5m3t-xjex`, 335 in `67is-svtd`. `ZIP_code` nulls: 13
  and 2. Negligible against 240k rows and both columns are stage-6 only, so
  not a problem now. Decide how to handle before any geographic split.

## Next session

- Walk through `explore.ipynb` line by line — understand the fetch code
  rather than just having it work.
